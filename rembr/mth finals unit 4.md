**Basic Statistics Terms**

### **Definition of Statistics**
Statistics is the science of analyzing numerical data to evaluate properties of a collection. It involves methods for collecting, organizing, summarizing, and interpreting data to draw conclusions and support decision-making.

### **Types of Statistics**

#### **Descriptive Statistics**
- Concerned with collecting, organizing, and utilizing numerical data from the empirical world.
- Describes and analyzes a given group without making inferences about a larger population.
- Focuses on:
	- Characterizing what is typical or common in a group.
	- Indicating variability within the group.
	- Presenting aspects of the distribution values of variables.
- **Examples:**
	- Mean
	- Percentages
	- Proportions
	- Standard deviation
	- Regression and correlation coefficient
	- Construction of tables, charts, and graphs

#### **Inferential Statistics**
- Involves analyzing a subset of data to make predictions or inferences about an entire set of data.
- Common analyses include:
	- Testing associations between variables.
	- Identifying relationships.
	- Refining associations into causal relationships.
	- Generalizing and predicting based on observed data.
- **Examples:**
	- Estimation
	- Hypothesis testing

### **Stages of Social Research**
1. Reducing the problem to testable hypotheses.
2. Collecting data.
3. Developing appropriate instruments.
4. Analyzing data.
5. Interpreting and communicating results.

---

### **General Uses of Statistics**
- Summarizing data for public use.
- Aiding in decision-making:
	- Providing comparisons.
	- Explaining past actions.
	- Justifying claims or assertions.
	- Predicting future outcomes.
	- Estimating unknown quantities.

### **Population and Sample**
- **Population:**
	- The totality of all actual or conceivable objects of a certain class under consideration. Can be finite or infinite.
- **Sampling Frame:**
	- A complete list of all units from which the sample is drawn.
- **Sample:**
	- A subset of the population.

- **Sampling:**
	- Selecting a representative cross-section of the population.
- **Representative:**
	- Reflects the characteristics of the population.
- **Survey:**
	- Collecting information on a defined population to satisfy a specific need.

- **Parameter:** Value calculated from a **population** distribution.
- **Statistic:** Value calculated from a **sample** distribution.
- **Variable:** Any quantity, measure, or characteristic that may have different values or categories.

#### **Classification of Variables**
- **Qualitative:** Differ in quality.
- **Quantitative:** Differ in magnitude.

- **Dependent Variables:** Criterion variables.
- **Independent Variables:** Predictor variables.

#### **Criteria for Selecting Variables**
1. Appropriateness.
2. Clarity.
3. Measurability.
4. Comparability.

### **Series of Numbers in Social Science Research**
- **Uses:**
  1. **Classify or categorize** at the nominal level of measurement.
  2. **Rank or order** at the ordinal level of measurement.
  3. **Assign a score** at the interval or ratio level of measurement.

---

### **Levels of Measurement** ‚Üì‚Üë

#### **Nominal Level** ‚Üì
- Classifies items into two or more categories.
- Each item must belong to one and only one category.
- **Examples:** Genotype, blood type, zip code, gender, race, eye color, political party.

#### **Ordinal Level**
- Specifies the relative position of items without indicating the distance between them.
- **Examples:** Level of education, income range, grades.

#### **Interval Level**
- Permits statements of equality of intervals.
- Does not have an absolute zero but allows comparison of differences.
- **Examples:** Temperature, grading marks, IQ scores.

#### **Ratio Level** ‚Üë
- Indicates actual amounts with an absolute zero point.
- Allows for statements of relative positions and proportions.
- **Examples:** Income, height, weight, annual sales, market share, time to repurchase, unemployment rate, crime rate.

### **Measuring Variables in Different Ways**
- **Nominal Level:**
  - Question: Are you currently in pain? [ ] Yes [ ] No
  - Characterizing type of pain: [ ] Sharp [ ] Dull [ ] Throbbing
- **Ordinal Level:**
  - How bad is the pain right now? [ ] None [ ] Mild [ ] Moderate [ ] Severe
- **Interval/Ratio Level:**
  - Rate pain on a 0‚Äì10 numerical scale.

## Measures of Central Tendency

### Definition of Terms
- **Central Tendency**: A central value around which scores are distributed.
- **Average**: A typical value representing a dataset, often referred to as the "center of gravity."
- **Mean (ùë•ÃÑ)**: The arithmetic average of observed values.
- **Median (ùë•ÃÉ)**: The middle value when observations are arranged in order.
- **Mode (ùë•ÃÑ)**: The most frequently observed value in a dataset.
--- 
### Mean
- **Arithmetic Mean**: ‚Äúcenter of gravity‚Äù of the data set
  - **Ungrouped Data**:

- **Grouped Data**: Utilizes class marks or midpoints for calculations.
	![[Pasted image 20241213055659.png]]

- Weighted Mean:

### Median
- the observation occupying the middle position when observations are arranged in an array

### Mode
- The observation that occurs most often

### Importance of Measures
- **Mean**: Most appropriate for unimodal symmetrical distributions.
- **Median**: Useful for skewed distributions as it is not influenced by extreme values.
- **Mode**: Represents the most common value, applicable for both qualitative and quantitative data.

## Measures of Variability

### Definition of Terms
- **Variability**: Describes how spread out data points are around an average.
- **Range (R)**: The difference between the highest and lowest values in a dataset.
- **Mean Deviation (MD)**: Average distance of observations from the mean.

- **Variance (œÉ¬≤)**: Measures the average of the squared differences from the mean.
	- œÉ¬≤ = population mean; s¬≤ = sample variance
- **Standard Deviation (œÉ / s)**: The square root of variance, indicating how much data varies from the mean.
- **Coefficient of Variation (cv)**: Expresses standard deviation as a percentage of the mean, useful for comparing variability across different datasets.

#### Range
- R = Highest - Lowest

#### Mean Deviation

## Examining Categorical Data Using Contingency Tables

### Definition and Purpose
- A **contingency table** displays frequencies of different variables in a matrix format, helping to illustrate relationships between them.
- Example: The Titanic dataset showing the relationship between ticket class and survival rates.

### Marginal Distribution
- The totals of each category in the contingency table, providing insight into the distribution of each variable.

## Sampling Techniques

### Overview of Sampling
- **Target Population**: The group from which information is desired.
- **Sampling Population**: The actual group from which samples are drawn.

### Types of Sampling
- **Probability Sampling**: Ensures every individual has a chance of being selected, minimizing bias.
  - **Simple Random Sampling**: Each member has an equal chance of selection.
  - **Stratified Sampling**: Population divided into subgroups before sampling to ensure representation.
  - **Cluster Sampling**: Involves selecting clusters or groups rather than individuals.
  
- **Non-Probability Sampling**: Not all individuals have a chance of selection, leading to potential bias.
  - Types include **judgment sampling**, **quota sampling**, and **snowball sampling**.

### Advantages of Probability Sampling
- Provides precise estimates and indicates the level of confidence in results, enhancing the reliability of statistical inferences.
