## Variables in Statistics

- **Overview:** In statistics, variables are characteristics or properties that can take on different values. They are classified into qualitative and quantitative types, as well as dependent and independent categories, which help in data analysis and interpretation.
- **Qualitative Variables:**
    - Also known as categorical variables.
    - Represent categories or qualities (e.g., gender, color).
    - Do not have a numerical value.
- **Quantitative Variables:**
    - Represent measurable quantities.
    - Can be further divided into:
        - **Discrete Variables:** Countable values (e.g., number of students).
        - **Continuous Variables:** Infinite possible values within a range (e.g., height, weight).
- **Dependent Variables:**
    - Also referred to as criterion variables.
    - The outcome variable that researchers measure in an experiment.
    - Its value depends on the influence of one or more independent variables.
- **Independent Variables:**
    - Also known as predictor variables.
    - The variable that is manipulated or controlled in an experiment.
    - Used to predict or explain changes in the dependent variable.



## Contingency Tables

- **Overview:** Contingency tables, also known as cross-tabulations or crosstabs, are statistical tools used to display the frequency distribution of two or more categorical variables. They help illustrate the interrelation between these variables and identify potential interactions.
- **Frequency Distribution:**
    - Represents how often each combination of variable categories occurs.
    - Provides a structured way to summarize data for analysis.
- **Marginal Distribution:**
    - Refers to the totals for each category of a single variable in the table.
    - Helps understand the overall distribution of each variable independently.
- **Interrelation of Variables:**
    - Analyzes the relationship between the two variables presented in the table.
    - Can reveal patterns, trends, or associations that may exist between the variables.

## Measures of Variability

- **Overview:** Measures of variability, or dispersion, quantify the extent to which data points in a dataset differ from each other and from the average. They help determine whether observations are similar (homogeneous) or vary significantly (heterogeneous).
- **Range:**
    - Defined as the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset.
    - Provides a simple measure of spread but does not account for distribution shape.
- **Variance:**
    - Represents the average of the squared differences from the mean.
    - Population variance (σ²) vs. sample variance (s²).
- **Standard Deviation:**
    - The positive square root of variance.
    - Indicates how much individual data points deviate from the mean.
    - Population standard deviation (σ) vs. sample standard deviation (s).
- **Coefficient of Variation:**
    - A relative measure of dispersion expressed as a percentage of the mean.
    - Formula: cv = (s / x̄) × 100%
    - Useful for comparing variability across different datasets; less informative if the mean is close to zero.
- **Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD):**
    - The average distance of each data point from the mean.
    - Can be calculated for both ungrouped and grouped data.
    - Provides insight into the average error in predictions based on the mean.

## Descriptive Statistics

- **Overview:** Descriptive statistics summarize and describe the main features of a dataset. They provide simple summaries about the sample and the measures, allowing for easier interpretation of data through various techniques such as central tendency, variability, and categorical analysis.
- **Measures of Central Tendency:**
    - **Mean:** The average value calculated by summing all data points and dividing by the number of points.
    - **Median:** The middle value when data points are arranged in ascending order; it divides the dataset into two equal halves.
    - **Mode:** The most frequently occurring value(s) in a dataset.
- **Measures of Variability:**
    - Assess the spread or dispersion of data points within a dataset.
    - Common metrics include range, variance, and standard deviation.

    - Easy to compute with a small number of observations.
    - Can be used for advanced statistical computations.
- **Mode:**
    
    - Most frequently observed value in a dataset.
    - Applicable for nominal, ordinal, ratio, and interval data.
    - Useful for bimodal distributions (two modes).
    - Requires no calculation for ungrouped data.
    - Can represent both quantitative and qualitative data.
- **Weighted Mean:**
    
    - Average where each value has a specific weight contributing to the total.
    - Useful when certain observations are more significant than others.
- **Applications:**
    
    - Used in various fields such as economics, psychology, and education to summarize data.
    - Helps in understanding data distributions and making informed decisions based on statistical analysis.
