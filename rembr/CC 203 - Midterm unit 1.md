simple data type - store 1 var at a time
structured data typee 0 data stored in other data items

array collection of a  fixed umber fo coonenets of same data type
one dimensional array components are arranged it list form

```cpp
dataType ArrayName [IndexExp];
```
indexExp: Index
	expression within a nonnegative int value
value of index is position in array
[] array subscripting operator
array always starts at zero

Basic operations on a one diemsnional array
	initializing
	inputting data
	outputting data
	finding the largest and/or smallest element
	each operation requires abilty to step through elements of an array
		easily accomplished by loop


```cpp
int list[100];

for (i=0;i<100;i++)
```
