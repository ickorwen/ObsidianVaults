# PH Education Crisis: Students Struggle, DepEd’s Solutions Questioned

### Students Falling Behind

- **Many Filipino students** are struggling with basic skills.
- A Grade 10 student, "Lawrence" (not his real name), **failed a spelling test completely**, writing "debry" for debris and "futhia" for fuchsia.
- **In his class of 40, many are failing** in multiple subjects, and some **can’t even read**.
- **Vice President & Education Secretary Sara Duterte admits**: “Learners are not academically proficient.”

### Shocking Data

- **2018 PISA results**:
    - **81% of students** can’t solve basic math problems.
    - **81% struggle with reading comprehension.**
    - **78% can’t explain scientific concepts.**
- **2019 SEA Learning Metrics**:
    - **Only 10% of Grade 5 students met reading standards.**
    - **Only 17% met math standards.**

### DepEd’s Plan: Learning Recovery

- **National Learning Recovery Plan (NLRP)** was created to fix learning losses from COVID-19.
- **New Program: National Learning Camp (NLC)** (July 7 - Aug. 28)
    - **Not mandatory** but **focuses on Grades 7 & 8** and K-12 remediation.
    - **Subjects: Reading, Math, Science.**
    - **Each class: 35 students max.**

### Teachers Say "No" to Extended Work

- **Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT) opposes NLC**, saying:
    - It **overworks teachers** who already have **no sick leave or vacation benefits**.
    - Teachers still have **graduation tasks, enrollment, and Brigada Eskwela**.
    - **Students also need a break!**
- **DepEd offers service credits** for volunteer teachers, but ACT says:
    - **Limit of 15 service credits per year is unfair.**
    - Teachers should **get 1.25 credits per extra day worked**.
    - Some teachers say **they aren’t even sure how to use these credits**.

### Root Problems DepEd Must Fix

1. **Overcrowded classrooms**
    - **28M students, but only 327,851 school buildings** (104,536 in good condition).
    - **Teachers handle 40-50 students per class**.
2. **Overworked teachers**
    - **Too many administrative tasks** instead of teaching.
    - DepEd promised to hire more teachers but **called ACT’s request for 30,000 new hires “unrealistic.”**
    - **PH still lacks 147,000 teachers!**

### The Real Solution?

- **Smaller class sizes** = better learning.
- **More teachers & admin staff** = less burnout.
- **Better learning materials & school facilities**.
- **No unnecessary weekend trainings or events for teachers**.

DepEd **must focus on real solutions** instead of short-term band-aids.

# **Learning Poverty and Moral Bankruptcy**

_By: Jose Ma. Montelibano | Philippine Daily Inquirer | 12:30 AM, August 26, 2022_

## **What is Learning Poverty?**

Poverty isn’t just about money—it can also mean a **lack of learning**. The term **"learning poverty"** was introduced by global institutions to describe the crisis in education.

A 2022 report, _The State of Global Learning Poverty_, by the **World Bank, UNICEF, USAID, UNESCO, and others**, reveals:

- Even **before** the pandemic, there was a **learning crisis**.
- **9 out of 10 Filipino children (age 10)** struggle to read simple texts.
- **91% of late primary-age children** in the Philippines are **not proficient in reading**.

### **How Does the Philippines Compare?**

- The country’s learning poverty rate is **56.4 points higher** than the regional average of **34.5%**.
- Among lower-middle-income countries, the Philippines lags by a shocking **80.5 points**.
- Once a leader in education, the country has fallen **below even some African nations**.

## **Why Is This Happening?**

The Philippines once took **pride** in its education. In the 1960s, Filipinos had major achievements in **economics, politics, and education**. Now, the decline is clear.

The term **"poverty"** is often used for economic struggles, but it also applies to **education**:

> _Poverty: "The state of being inferior in quality or insufficient in amount."_

Similarly, the word **"bankrupt"** isn’t just about money. It can also mean:

> _"Completely lacking in a particular quality or value, as in a cause being morally bankrupt."_

## **Is Learning Poverty Linked to Moral Bankruptcy?**

The author argues **yes**—morality and education are closely connected.

- Learning isn’t just about **reading and numbers**.
- It’s also about **values, principles, and character**—things taught at **home, school, and community**.
- If these decline, **so does education**.

### **Is It Genetic?**

- **No**, Filipinos didn’t suddenly become less intelligent.
- OFWs and immigrants thrive **internationally** because of strong reading, comprehension, and communication skills.
- Yet, back home, education is collapsing.

## **What’s Causing This Decline?**

1. **A Broken Education System** – The curriculum is outdated and **not preparing students** for the future.
2. **A Toxic Political & Social Environment** – Constant **division, misinformation, and conflict** in media and politics erode morality.
3. **A Focus on “Wars” Instead of Vision** – The government fights wars on **drugs, corruption, red tape, insurgency, terrorism**, but **where are the inspiring goals** for the next generations?

## **A Young Population at Risk**

The Philippines has a **young workforce**, which should be an advantage. But if the **next generation is illiterate**, that advantage disappears.

## **The Need for Role Models**

The **bankruptcy of morality** and the **poverty of learning** feed into each other. Without ethical leadership, education will continue to **decline**, hurting the country’s future.

The question is: **Do our leaders even care?**

# **AI: A Double-Edged Sword**

_Philippine Daily Inquirer | 05:13 AM, November 7, 2023_

## **The Fear of AI**

AI is advancing fast, and people worry about what it means for the future. The biggest fear? That humans could be replaced by something more intelligent than themselves.

As AI improves, it raises questions once found only in sci-fi:

- Will AI achieve sentience?
- Is any job safe from automation?
- Could AI take over civilization?

## **AI’s Dark Side**

Beyond job loss, AI poses real dangers:

- **Dictators** using AI to manipulate elections and spy on rivals
- **Cybercriminals** creating advanced phishing scams
- **Terrorists** developing new bioweapons
- **Deepfakes** spreading false information, leading to chaos

These threats exist even without AI, but deep-learning algorithms could make things much worse.

## **AI’s Bright Side**

AI also has **huge potential** to improve the world. As British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said (Oct. 30):

> “AI can help solve world hunger by preventing crop failures… accelerate the transition to net zero… and make breakthroughs in health and medicine, aiding in the search for new dementia treatments and cancer vaccines.”

AI could **revolutionize** industries, but only if governments manage its risks.

## **What’s the Philippines Doing?**

On Nov. 1, the Philippines joined 27 nations and the EU in signing the **Bletchley Declaration**—a global AI safety agreement. The goal:

> “Ensure human-centric, trustworthy and responsible AI that is safe.”

But signing a pact isn’t enough.

- In 2021, the Department of Trade and Industry launched a plan to make the Philippines an **AI powerhouse**—but progress has stalled.
- **6 House bills** and **2 Senate resolutions** on AI exist, but lawmakers haven’t acted.
- Some organizations are stepping in (e.g., UP’s guidelines against AI cheating, the Supreme Court’s plans for AI in legal processes).

## **The Urgency of AI Regulation**

Information and Communications Technology Secretary Ivan John Uy warned:

> “Without proper regulation, AI could become dangerous… and it’s evolving very, very fast.”

But where are the **solutions**?

Without clear policies, the Philippines risks falling behind as AI reshapes industries—finance, healthcare, agriculture, logistics, media, and more.

**Example:** In September, GMA launched **AI sportscasters** on air. How long before journalists and other jobs are replaced, too?

## **Time to Act**

AI is here, whether we like it or not. The sooner we regulate it, the better we can **protect jobs, industries, and our future**.

The question remains: **Will our government act in time?**
