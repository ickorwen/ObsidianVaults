Before we even entered formal education, one of the first things we learned as children was to write and say our names. Our parents carefully chose these names, perhaps after a famous figure, saint, or someone they admired. Our names become a key part of our identity; they aren’t random combinations of letters but are meant to represent us. We are taught to respond when called and to always sign our names on our work because they signify who we are, even beyond death, as seen on gravestones. However, a name is just a signifier, not a person itself. Being named after a saint doesn’t make you saintly. The true self is something we’re simply born with or assigned by our parents.

**SOCRATES**  
The first philosopher to engage in systematic questioning about the self.

- _Know thyself._
- _The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing._
- _Knowledge is virtue; ignorance is vice._
    - All vice is the result of ignorance, and no person is willingly bad.
- _Ultimate wisdom comes from knowing oneself._
- _The unexamined life is not worth living._
    - One’s life needs to be evaluated; actions and events need to be thought over.
- The worst thing that could happen to a man is to live but die inside.

**CONCEPT OF DUALISM**

- Every human person is dualistic, composed of two important aspects of personhood: the body and the soul.
    - **Body** → imperfect, impermanent
    - **Soul** → perfect, permanent

---

**PLATO**  
Plato, Socrates’ student, built upon his master’s ideas and supported the notion that man has a dual nature: body and soul.

- Plato added that the soul consists of three parts:
    - ==**Rational soul**== - governed by reason and intellect, which should guide the human person.
    - ==**Spirited soul**== - responsible for will and volition, which should be controlled.
    - ==**Appetitive soul**== - in charge of base desires (e.g., eating, drinking, sleeping, and having sex), which should also be regulated.
- Justice in the human person can only be attained when these three parts work harmoniously. (_The Republic_, 2000).
- When this ideal state is achieved, the human person becomes just and virtuous.

---

**ST. AUGUSTINE**  
Augustine’s view of the human person reflects the medieval world’s spirit, blending Plato’s ancient philosophy with Christianity.

- Augustine believed in the bifurcated nature of man:
    - The **body** dwells in the imperfect world and yearns to be with the Divine.
    - The **soul** is capable of reaching immortality and living eternally in spiritual bliss with God.
    - The body can only thrive in the imperfect, physical world, while the soul anticipates eternal life in communion with God after death.
- The goal of every human person is to attain this union with the Divine by living virtuously on earth.
- Augustine created a new concept of individual identity:
    - Identity is achieved through a two-fold process of self-presentation, which leads to self-realization.

---

**RENE DESCARTES**  
René Descartes, the Father of Modern Philosophy, conceived of the human person as having both a body and a mind.

- _Cogito ergo sum_ – "I think, therefore I am."
- In _Meditations on First Philosophy_, Descartes argues that we should doubt much of what we think and believe, as it might be false.
    - He claims that only what can pass the test of doubt should be believed (Descartes, 2008).
    - The only thing that one cannot doubt is the existence of the self, for even if one doubts oneself, that only proves that there is a doubting self, a thing that thinks and therefore, that cannot be doubted. 
	    - The fact that one thinks should lead one to conclude without a doubt that he exists.

**TWO DISTINCT ENTITIES OF THE SELF ACCORDING TO DESCARTES:** 
- The self is nothing but a mind-body dichotomy 
	- Cogito - the thing that thinks (the mind) 
	- Extenza - the extension of the mind (the body) 
- In Descartes’ view, the body is nothing but a machine that is attached to the mind.
	- The human person has it but it is not what makes man a man.

---
**JOHN LOCKE**

- Everyone started as a blank slate (_==tabula rasa==_), and the content is provided by one’s experiences over time.
    - ==_Empiricism_== – belief that knowledge comes from senses and experiences.
- Locke’s popular book, _An Essay Concerning Human Understanding_, describes the self as a mind whose function is to understand all empirical data processed in it.
- He considered ==personal identity (self) to be founded on consciousness (memory) and not on the substance of either soul or body.==
- He ==rejected that the brain has anything to do with consciousness==, as both the brain and body may change, while consciousness remains the same.
    - Our body deteriorates as we age, as does our brain, but not consciousness.
- There is no clear and intelligible idea of the self (neither soul nor body). Personal identity is a matter of psychological continuity.

---

**DAVID HUME**  
David Hume, a Scottish philosopher, had a unique way of viewing man.

- The self is not an entity beyond the physical body.
- _Empiricism_ is the school of thought that believes knowledge can only come from what is sensed and experienced.
    - _e.g._, Jack knows Jill is a human person not because he has seen her soul, but because he sees, hears, and touches her.
- The ==self is nothing but a bundle of impressions.==

---

**TWO CATEGORIES OF EXPERIENCE**

- **Impression** – the basic objects of our experience or sensation. They form the core of our thoughts and are the products of direct experience with the world.
    
    - _e.g._, Touching an ice cube (impression: the cold sensation).
- **Ideas** – copies of impressions. They are not as vivid or lively as our impressions.
    
    - _e.g._, When one imagines the feeling of being in love, that is an idea.
- According to Hume, the self is simply “a bundle or collection of different perceptions, which succeed each other with an inconceivable rapidity, and are in a perpetual flux and movement” (_Hume and Steinberg, 1992_).
    
- Men want to believe there is a unified, coherent self—a soul or mind like previous philosophers believed.
    
    - In reality, what one considers a unified self is just a combination of experiences with a particular person.
    - There is no self that remains the same; self is always changing.

---

**IMMANUEL KANT**  
Thinking of the “self” as a mere combination of impressions was problematic for Immanuel Kant. He recognized the truth in Hume’s claim that everything starts with perception and sensation of impression.

- There is an inner and outer self.
- Kant believed that things perceived by humans are not randomly infused without an organizing principle that regulates the relationship of all these impressions.
- There is necessarily a mind that organizes impressions from the external world.
    - _e.g._, Time and space are ideas one cannot find in the world but are built in our minds. Kant calls these the apparatuses of the mind.
- Without the self, one cannot organize the different impressions one receives in relation to their own existence.
    - He suggests that an actively engaged intelligence in man synthesizes all knowledge and experience.
- The self is not only what gives one personality, but it is also the seat of knowledge acquisition for all humans.
---
**SIGMUND FREUD**  
**Psychoanalytic Perspective of Sigmund Freud**:

- Unconscious motives and conflicts are central to present behavior.
- Irrational forces are strong; the person is driven by sexual desires (libido) and aggressive impulses.
- Early childhood experiences lay the foundation for adult personality.
- Basic to Freud's theory is the idea that unacceptable childhood wishes and desires, primarily libidinal, are repressed in consciousness or driven out of awareness.
- Repressed drives seek expression in dreams, slips of speech, and unconscious mannerisms. These are often the sources of inner conflicts.

Freud viewed humans as innately negative creatures, relentlessly driven by two biological instincts (or motives):

1. **Eros (Life Instinct)** – Helps the individual survive by directing life-sustaining activities.
    - _e.g._, respiration, eating, sex.
2. **Thanatos (Death Instinct)** – Viewed as a destructive force present in all humans.
    - _e.g._, destructive acts like arson, murder, war.

---

**How Does Personality Develop?**

- According to Freud, individual personality follows the **psychosexual stages of development**. He believed sexual feelings were central to personality development, even in infancy.
    - Freud argued that anything giving pleasure is sexual.
- He proposed that as we progress through each stage of life, a different region of the body becomes the most erogenous.
    - **Erogenous Zone** – A source of pleasure.

---

**PSYCHOSEXUAL STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT**

- Each stage presents individuals with a unique conflict that must be resolved before advancing to the next stage.
- Failure to resolve the conflict results in **fixation**.

---

**Key Terms**:

- **Erogenous Zone** – A part of the skin or mucous membrane that is extremely sensitive to irritation but gives pleasure when manipulated.
- **Fixation** – An obsessive drive, potentially unacted upon, involving an object, concept, or person. It is the persistent focus of the id’s pleasure-seeking energies at an early stage of psychosexual development.
    - If a psychosexual stage is not adequately satisfied, fixation is likely to develop.

---
**GILBERT RYLE**  
Gilbert Ryle addresses the mind-body dichotomy by ==denying the concept of an internal, non-physical self.==

- He explains that there is no hidden entity called “the mind” inside a mechanical apparatus called “the body.”
- He opposed Descartes’ notion of a man as a “thinking thing.” He maintained that the mind is not separate from the body.
- The mind consists of dispositions of people based on what they know, feel, and want. People learn they have minds because they behave in certain ways.
    - For Ryle, what truly matters is the behavior that a person manifests in their day-to-day life.
- The self is a combination of the mind (the disposition to know, believe, feel, and act) and the body.
- Mental concepts can be understood through observable events (logical/analytical behaviorism).
- **“I act, therefore I am”**: The mind is not the seat of self, but behavior is, opposing Descartes’ immaterial mind in a material body.

**Analogy of Ryle’s Philosophy**  
Ryle suggests that looking for and trying to understand the self is like visiting a university and looking for the "university" itself. One may explore the campus, library, and other facilities but still not find the "university" because it is composed of the campus, people, and systems. Similarly, the "self" is not an entity to locate but a convenient label for behaviors.

---

**PAUL AND PATRICIA CHURCHLAND**  
Paul and Patricia Churchland, both neuroscientists, assert that the self is entirely tied to the physical brain.

- In Patricia Churchland’s book _Touching a Nerve: The Self as Brain_ (2013), she wrote:
    - _“My brain and I are inseparable. I am who I am because my brain is what it is. I think of myself as me and my brain as that, but I know my memory is all about the neurons in my brain. Lately, I think about my brain in more intimate terms — as me.”_
- This supports the idea that understanding the self requires studying the brain, not just the mind.
- Churchland argues that since the mind cannot be experienced by our senses, it does not truly exist.
    - It is our physical brain, not an imaginary mind, that gives us our sense of self.

---
**MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY**  
Maurice Merleau-Ponty, a phenomenologist, asserts that the mind-body bifurcation is a futile and invalid problem.

- Unlike Ryle, who simply denies the "self," Merleau-Ponty states that the mind and body are so intertwined that they cannot be separated from one another.
    - One cannot find any experience that is not an embodied experience.
    - One’s body is his opening toward his existence in the world.
    - Because of these bodies, humans exist in the world.

**Two Types of Body (these are not separate bodies):**

1. **The Subjective Body** – As lived and experienced (embodied subjectivity): Humans are living creatures whose consciousness or subjectivity is actualized through their physical involvement with the world. The body is the general medium for having a world, and we understand the world not through intellect but through experience.
2. **The Objective Body** – As observed and scientifically investigated: The body that is known to others – the body that people see, admire, imitate, criticize, or even dissect.

- Mind or consciousness cannot be defined solely in terms of self-knowledge or representation but is essentially engaged in the structures and actions of the human world, encompassing the diverse intentional orientations of human life.
- For phenomenologists like Merleau-Ponty, to be a subject (self) requires a body. His idea of _“I am my body”_ cannot be interpreted as advocating a materialist or behaviorist position. He acknowledges the existence of mental states, but emphasizes that the use of the mind is inseparable from our bodily, situated, physical nature.
- The body cannot be viewed solely as an object or material entity of the world.

---

**Sense of Self**

- The way a person thinks about and views their traits, beliefs, and purpose within the world.
- Refers to a person’s experience as a single, unitary, autonomous being, separate from others, experienced with continuity through time and place.
- The experience of the self begins with identifying oneself as an object, followed by describing oneself as a self-concept or self-feeling, and ends with manifesting the self in how one acts and presents themselves to others.

**The Self as Cognitive Construct**

- How people define themselves in relation to others greatly influences how they think, feel, and behave, ultimately related to the construct of identity.
- Self-development is a continuous process throughout the lifespan, meaning one’s sense of self may change somewhat over time.
- Self-representation has important implications for socio-emotional functioning throughout life.
---

**WILLIAM JAMES**  
William James' theory of the self, presented in _The Principles of Psychology_, explores the nature of self-perception and identity through two components:

1. **The "I" Self:**
    
    - The thinking subject, representing self-awareness and the ability to observe existence. It is responsible for the stream of consciousness.
2. **The "Me" Self:**
    
    - The self as an object of thought, divided into three components:
        - **Material Self:** Tangible aspects such as the body, possessions, and relationships, including both bodily and extracorporeal selves (e.g., family, home).
        - **Social Self:** The self as perceived by others, changing with different social contexts.
        - **Spiritual Self:** The core self, encompassing values, personality, and moral character, more stable than the material or social selves.

- James emphasized that these aspects of the self are hierarchically related: the material self is the most basic, followed by the social self, and the spiritual self is the most intimate and significant.
- He highlighted that self-perception is not static but shaped by experiences and interactions throughout life.

---

**CARL ROGERS**  
Carl Rogers' Self Theory emphasizes that the self develops gradually during childhood as individuals differentiate between the self and non-self.

- He believed individuals actively shape their identity through free choice and action, based on personal values.
- Rogers viewed the self as the center of experience, continually shaping how one perceives and responds to their environment.

**Real Self vs. Ideal Self**  
Rogers proposed two important concepts in self-development:

1. **The Real Self:**
    
    - Represents who a person truly is, authentically and intrinsically, reflecting their natural thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. The real self is essential for self-acceptance and self-care, rooted in one’s core values.
2. **The Ideal Self:**
    
    - Represents who a person wishes or strives to be, influenced by societal expectations and external pressures. It is dynamic but can create pressure when it diverges significantly from the real self.

**Importance of Alignment**

- **Congruence:**
    - Rogers emphasized the significance of congruence between the real self and the ideal self. When these two selves are aligned, individuals experience mental well-being and a sense of self-worth.
- **Incongruence:**
    - A large gap between the real self and the ideal self can lead to stress, anxiety, and dissatisfaction. This incongruence may result in feelings of failure and discouragement, as the ideal self can appear unattainable.
- **Optimal Mental Health:**
    - Rogers suggested that striving for congruence between the real and ideal selves is essential for optimal mental health.
- **Self-Actualization:**
    - Achieving this alignment allows individuals to experience self-actualization and a sense of peace, as they live authentically and in accordance with their true values.

---

**SOCIOLOGY**

- **Social Nature:**
    - "No man is an island" — individuals inherently seek companionship and communion with others.
    - The human person is a social animal, always seeking others for commercial or personal reasons. We have an innate desire to be part of a group.

**Sociology Defined:**

- The scientific study of relationships, focusing on social norms and values.

**Social Factors Influencing Self:**

- Political system
- Children
- Partners
- School
- Location
- Education
- Economic status
- Physical status
- Religion
- Wealth
- Family
- Ethnicity

**Self in Sociology:**

- The self is viewed as a product of modern society, in contrast to other constructs or archetypes.

---
### THE SELF AS A PRODUCT OF SOCIETY

- The self is not a biological predisposition but a product of social interaction.
- Identity and behavior are shaped through interactions with individuals, groups, and institutions in society.

---

### GEORGE HERBERT MEAD’S SOCIAL SELF

- **Development of Self:**
    - The self is developed through social interactions rather than biology.
    - It emerges through engagement with the world and reflection on experiences.

**Case Study: The Story of Genie**

- Genie, a girl confined in a room until the age of 13, exemplifies the impact of social interaction on self-development.
- Upon discovery, she could not walk or speak, indicating that although her body developed normally, her "self" had not.

---

### STAGES OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT

A framework for understanding how individuals develop a sense of self through social interaction:

1. **Role-Playing vs. Role-Taking**
    - **Role-playing:**
        - Involves imitating behaviors associated with specific social roles without fully understanding the broader context.
    - **Role-taking:**
        - Involves understanding and adopting another person's perspective, allowing the individual to view situations from another's viewpoint.

---

### Stages of Development

- **Preparatory Stage (Birth - 2 years)**
    
    - Children imitate behaviors without understanding social roles (basic role-playing).
    - Role-taking is absent; children are limited to observation and imitation.
    - **Example:** A child pretends to talk on a phone but does not understand the purpose or context.
- **Play Stage (2 - 6 years)**
    
    - Role-playing becomes more sophisticated as children begin to understand roles from their limited perspective.
    - Role-taking emerges but is confined to the specific roles they play.
    - **Example:** A child playing "house" takes on the role of a parent without fully understanding the child’s perspective or other family dynamics.
- **Game Stage (around Age 7)**
    
    - Children understand how different roles interact within structured systems (e.g., team sports).
    - Role-taking matures, allowing for the adoption of multiple perspectives simultaneously.
    - **Example:** In soccer, a child understands their position as well as the roles of teammates, opponents, and coaches.
    - **Concept of Generalized Other:**
        - Children internalize societal expectations, norms, and values.
        - They comprehend that society has rules governing behavior and can view themselves from the standpoint of the broader community.
        - **Example:** A child playing soccer understands their behavior on the field in relation to societal norms and the expectations of teammates and coaches.

---

### “I” and “Me” Self

- **Internal Conversation:**
    - Mead posits that all humans experience an internal conversation between the “I” and the “me,” which he termed the phases of the self.
    - The self is a social process involving the interaction between the “I” and “me.”

---

#### “I” Self

- **Definition:**
    - The subjective self that is unsocialized and spontaneous.
- **Characteristics:**
    - Represents the spontaneous, creative, and unique aspects of the self.
    - Acts instinctively in response to experiences and interactions without premeditation.
    - Reflects individual responses, desires, emotions, and impulses, allowing for personal creativity and self-expression.
    - Focused on the present moment and future possibilities, representing an individual's response to the environment and potential for new experiences.

---

#### “Me” Self

- **Definition:**
    - The socialized aspect of the self.
- **Characteristics:**
    - Represents how individuals perceive themselves based on societal expectations, norms, and attitudes internalized through interactions with others.
    - More reflective and analytical, it includes the organized set of attitudes adopted from the perspectives of others.
    - Allows individuals to evaluate actions and adjust behaviors according to social norms.
    - Incorporates past experiences and lessons learned from social interactions, reflecting how individuals have been shaped by their interactions with family, peers, media, and institutions.

---

### Dynamic Interaction of “I” and “Me”

- The “I” and “Me” are in a constant, dynamic process, interacting as individuals navigate social life.
- The “Me” influences the “I” by providing a framework of societal expectations, guiding responses to situations.
- While the “I” enables creativity and spontaneous actions, the “Me” tempers these actions with social norms, facilitating a balance between individual expression and social acceptance.
- Full development of the self is achieved when the “I” and “Me” are united.

---

### The Socialization Process

- **Definition:**
    - Socialization is how individuals learn the expectations of society, varying based on race, gender, and class.

---

#### Agents of Socialization

1. **Family**
    
    - The primary agent of socialization; children learn basic norms, values, and behaviors from their families.
    - Variations in socialization based on race, gender, and class, influencing manners, communication styles, and traditions.
    - Early sense of self heavily influenced by family interactions (e.g., respect for elders, table manners).
2. **Media**
    
    - Children are exposed to 6-7 hours of media daily, impacting their thoughts and behaviors.
    - Media shapes attitudes and behaviors through mimicry of characters and situations depicted in television and online content.
3. **Peers**
    
    - Interaction with peers is vital in shaping self-identity, teaching social skills and values that may differ from family teachings.
    - As children grow, peer opinions and behaviors become significant in their social integration.
4. **Religion**
    
    - Children often adopt their parents' religious beliefs and practices, shaping their worldview and morality.
    - Individuals may return to their original faith later in life, influenced by strong family ties.
5. **Schools**
    
    - Schools teach societal expectations beyond the family context, with teachers and classmates influencing behavior.
    - Research indicates differential treatment of boys and girls by teachers, with boys often receiving more attention.

### Anthropology

**Cultural Anthropology**

- **Definition:** The study of human culture and society, focusing on the origins, development, and contemporary variations of human beings (Ferraro, 2008).

---

### Culture

- **Definition:**
    - Refers to how humans adapt to their environment and give meaning to their lives.
    - Includes learned behaviors, ideas, and the material objects produced by a group of people (Nanda and Warren, 2007).

---

### Self and Culture

- **Influence of Culture:**
    - Culture shapes individual self-perception, influencing worldviews, relationships, and decision-making.
    - Upbringing and cultural environment can result in either a positive or negative sense of self.

---

### Cultural Impact on Identity

- **Diverse Concepts of Self:**
    - Different cultures have varying definitions of the “self” and personal identity.
    - Cultural values and education systems are crucial in forming personal identity.

---

### Origins of the Self

- **Exploration:**
    - Anthropology examines both genetic (nature) and cultural (nurture) influences on the self, including socialization and language.

---

### Anthropology’s View on the Self

- **Holistic Approach:**
    - Focuses on the interaction between biology (nature) and culture (nurture) in understanding human identity.
- **Nature vs. Nurture Debate:**
    - **Nature:** Genetic factors influencing physical traits and aspects of personality.
    - **Nurture:** Environmental influences (family, culture, education, social interactions) that shape individual identity.

---

### The Self as Embedded in Culture

- **Cultural Differences:**
    - Different meanings assigned to events and things by various groups indicate that the self is embedded in culture.
    - The self is profoundly connected to and shaped by the culture of belonging.

---

### Clifford Geertz’s View on Culture and Self

- **Cultural Linkage:**
