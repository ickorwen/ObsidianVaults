- **Deductive Reasoning:**
    - Uses general principles to deduce specific outcomes.
    - Valid if premises guarantee the conclusion.
    - Example: All ducks have feathers since ducks are birds, and birds have feathers.
- **Conjectures and Counterexamples:**
    - Conjectures: Hypotheses based on observed patterns.
    - Counterexamples: Cases disproving conjectures, ensuring accuracy in reasoning.
## Mathematical Patterns

- **Overview:** Mathematical patterns consist of sequences of numbers following specific rules, enabling predictions about subsequent terms. Recognizing these patterns is essential for solving problems across mathematical domains.

### Sequences

- **Definition:** An ordered list of numbers where each number is termed a "term."
- **Examples:** For the sequence 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, the terms are a1=2a_1 = 2, a2=6a_2 = 6, etc.
- **Nth-Term Formula:** A mathematical expression used to find any term in the sequence. For example, an=n2+na_n = n^2 + n.

### Rules for Patterns

- **Rule Definition:** Specifies how to calculate or generate terms.
- **Example:** For an=n2+na_n = n^2 + n, substituting values of nn generates the terms: 2, 6, 12, etc.

### Predicting Terms

- **Difference Tables:**
    - Used to identify patterns by calculating differences between terms.
    - **Example:** Sequence 2, 5, 8, 11, 14 has a first difference of 3, predicting the next term as 17.
- **Nth-Term Formula:**
    - Directly predicts any term.
    - **Example:** For an=3n2+na_n = 3n^2 + n, a40=3(40)2+40=4840a_{40} = 3(40)^2 + 40 = 4840.

### Problem Solving with Patterns

- Identify sequences and apply suitable techniques like:
    - Constructing difference tables.
    - Using nth-term formulas.
- Example: Solve for the 40th term using the given formula, as demonstrated above.

## Fibonacci Numbers

- **Overview:** Fibonacci numbers are a sequence where each term is the sum of the two preceding terms, beginning with F1=1F_1 = 1 and F2=1F_2 = 1. Applications include nature, art, and mathematical theory.

### Properties

- **Definition:** Fn=Fn−1+Fn−2F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} for n≥3n \geq 3.
- **Example Conjecture:** 2Fn−Fn−2=Fn+12F_n - F_{n-2} = F_{n+1} for n≥3n \geq 3.

### Reasoning and Conjectures

- **Inductive Reasoning:**
    - Formulates conjectures by observing patterns.
    - Example: Test whether Fn−Fn−2=Fn+1F_n - F_{n-2} = F_{n+1}.
- **Conjectures:**
    - Example: If nn is even, FnF_n is odd (false).
    - Verify 2Fn+Fn+1=Fn+32F_n + F_{n+1} = F_{n+3} for n≥3n \geq 3.

### Mathematical Proofs

- Involve rigorous methods to validate conjectures.
- Example: Use algebraic manipulation or induction to prove identities like Fn+2=Fn+1+FnF_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n.
