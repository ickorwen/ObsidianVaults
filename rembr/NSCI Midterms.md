#### **Nature of Science**

1. **Science, Technology, and Society (STS)**
    
    - **Science**: Systematic study of nature and its phenomena.
    - **Technology**: Application of knowledge to achieve practical purposes.
    - **Society**: A system of individuals cohabiting with shared goals.
    - **STS**: A discipline that helps individuals understand, adapt, and respond to changes in their environment.
2. **The Scientific Worldview**
    
    - The universe is understandable.
    - The universe operates under consistent laws.
    - Scientific ideas evolve and are subject to change.
    - Scientific knowledge is durable but not absolute.
    - Science cannot provide answers to all questions.
3. **Nature of Scientific Inquiry**
    
    - Science relies on **evidence**.
    - The **scientific method** includes:
        1. Observation of phenomena
        2. Formulating hypotheses
        3. Predicting outcomes
        4. Conducting experiments
        5. Collecting data and refining theories
4. **Scientific Laws and Theories**
    
    - **Models** help explain complex phenomena.
    - **Scientific Theories**: Verified explanations of observed events.
    - **Scientific Laws**: General principles that describe consistent natural behavior.
5. **The Experimental Method**
    
    - Involves controlled manipulation of variables to determine cause and effect.
    - Ensures objectivity by minimizing bias.
6. **Science as a Way of Knowing**
    
    - Uses systematic observation, reasoning, and validation.
    - Progresses through self-correction and peer review.
